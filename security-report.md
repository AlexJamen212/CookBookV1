# Security Report - Kelly's Cookbook Desktop Version

## Date: 2025-08-14

## Analysis Summary
Analyzed the desktop version of Kelly's Cookbook (cookbook.html) for security vulnerabilities.

## Current Architecture
- **Frontend**: Single HTML file with embedded JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js server (server.js) with Express
- **Storage**: JSON file storage (recipes.json)
- **Data Flow**: Client → Server API → JSON file

## Security Findings

### ✅ LOW RISK - Already Secure
1. **No Direct innerHTML Usage**: Recipe rendering uses safe text content methods
2. **Local Storage Usage**: Only stores UI preferences (expanded state), not sensitive data
3. **Input Validation**: Basic validation present for required fields
4. **CORS Headers**: Server appears to use standard Express setup

### ⚠️ MEDIUM RISK - Should Fix
1. **No Input Sanitization**: User inputs for recipe names, ingredients, and instructions are not sanitized
   - **Risk**: Potential XSS if special characters are used
   - **Fix**: Add input sanitization before saving

2. **No CSRF Protection**: API endpoints lack CSRF tokens
   - **Risk**: Cross-site request forgery possible
   - **Fix**: Not critical for local app, but should add for production

3. **HTTP Only**: App uses http://localhost:3000
   - **Risk**: No encryption for data in transit
   - **Fix**: Use HTTPS in production (not critical for local use)

### ✅ NO HIGH RISK ISSUES FOUND

## Recommendations for PWA Conversion

1. **Content Security Policy**: Add CSP headers to prevent XSS
2. **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize all user inputs before storage
3. **Secure Context**: PWA requires HTTPS (localhost is exempt)
4. **Service Worker Security**: Ensure SW only caches appropriate content

## Data Storage Analysis
- **Current**: Server-side JSON file storage
- **PWA Target**: Client-side localStorage for offline capability
- **Security Impact**: Data moves to client - acceptable for recipe data

## Conclusion
The desktop version has no critical security vulnerabilities. Minor improvements recommended during PWA conversion.
